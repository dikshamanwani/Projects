Created a new visualization based on an existing Makeover Monday visualization (Who do Americans spend their time with). I chose this visualization and watched the reviews by 'Watch Me Viz' and 'Viz Review'. Then, used the feedback from the reviews to improve the original visualization.

This was a way for me to learn how to improve my data visualization skills.
