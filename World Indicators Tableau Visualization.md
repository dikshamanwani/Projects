## Description
Created an Interactive Tableau Story that contains visualizations and dashboards and answers the following questions:

1. Which countries are considered developed/underdeveloped under each threshold (12,000; 15,000; 25,000; 30,000)?

[For questions 2 to 5, threshold = 12,000]

2. How do GDP Per Capita, Life Expectancy Overall, Birth Rate, and Infant Mortality compare between developed and underdeveloped countries over time?

3. What was the relationship between GDP and Population for developed and underdeveloped countries in 2011?

4. Which countries were closer to becoming developed in 2011?

5. Where was the US trending towards in GDP Per Capita, Life Expectancy Overall, and Birth Rate and Infant Mortality?
